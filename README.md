# Text Summarization & Detection Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Text Summarization and Detection system** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Transformer-based models. The system takes input text, generates concise summaries, and evaluates the quality of generated summaries using automatic metrics.

It is designed for research, experimentation, and deployment in real-world applications like news summarization, document analysis, and intelligent chat systems.

## ✨ Features

* Supports **abstractive text summarization** using transformer-based models.
* Fine-tuned models for improved performance.
* Evaluation with **ROUGE** scores.
* Preprocessing pipeline: tokenization, cleaning, and truncation.
* Easy-to-extend architecture for different summarization datasets.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Programming Language**: Python
* **Libraries & Frameworks**:

  * Hugging Face Transformers
  * Datasets
  * Evaluate (ROUGE)
  * NLTK
  * NumPy

## 📦 Installation

Clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-summarization-detection.git
cd text-summarization-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Preprocess the dataset

```bash
python src/preprocess.py --dataset cnn_dailymail
```

### 2. Train the model

```bash
python src/train.py --model t5-small --epochs 3
```

### 3. Evaluate

```bash
python src/evaluate.py --model checkpoints/best_model
```

## 📊 Datasets

* [CNN/DailyMail](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_dailymail)
* [XSum](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xsum)

You can replace with custom datasets by adjusting `preprocess.py`.

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

* **ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L** for summarization quality.
* Supports additional evaluation metrics (BLEU, METEOR) if required.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Add multilingual summarization support.
* Integrate abstractive + extractive hybrid approaches.
* Deploy as a web API with **FastAPI/Flask**.
* Enhance detection of poor-quality summaries.
